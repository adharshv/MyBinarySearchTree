# MyBinarySearchTree
Expanding opearations of Binary Search Tree
Extended the Binary Search Tree code to achieve isFull (checks whether tree is full), compareStructure (inspects if two trees have the same 
structure), equals (checks if two trees are identical), copy (returns a copy of the original tree), 
mirror (returns a new tree that is a mirror image of the original tree) functionality.
